# Turtle Phylogeny and Climate Change: A Bioinformatics Capstone Project

This project retraces the steps of Thomas et al.'s research on turtle phylogeny and climate change. As a bioinformatics capstone project, it explores the evolutionary relationships of turtles in the context of climate change.

## Project Overview

This project was based on the article by Thomas et al. Retraced the steps for what these researchers did. I have an interest in turtles and this was an article that focused on turtles and climate change. This was for my bioinformatics capstone

Here is all the information needed for this research.

## Programs Used

*   R Studio
*   Python
*   Command Prompt (for running scripts)
*   Entrez Batch
*   MAFFT
*   BMGE
*   FASconCAT
*   IQ-Tree
*   FigTree
* strawbeery perl for fasconcat 
* Docker to help run BMGE

## Workflow

### Step 1: Article and Dataset

*   **Article:** https://www.pnas.org/doi/suppl/10.1073/pnas.2012215118
*   Download the article.
* I added the dataset from the article and the cleaned dataset.
* the dataset is cleaned so that there are no missing values, no - and the N

### Step 2: Clean Dataset

*   Clean the dataset to remove missing values (e.g., "-").
*   **Important:** Empty values can cause issues with Entrez Batch and subsequent species naming.
*   The dataset should now be clean.

### Step 3: Accession Code Extraction

*   Run the cleaned dataset on Entrez Batch.
*   **Run the script to generate the accession codes**
*   Expected output: 15 files, each containing accession codes for a specific gene.
*   **Note:** Ensure files contain only accession codes.
*   Run each file on Entrez Batch (nucleotide).
*   Save each file as `.fas` format.

### Step 4: DNA Sequences

*   Expected input: 15 files generated by Entrez Batch.
*   Ensure species names match across all files.
*   Run the script to clean the species names.
* make sure that it ends with .fas file 


### Step 5: Alignment

*   Run the MAFFT script for sequence alignment.
*   Run the BMGE script for alignment refinement.

### Step 6: FASconCAT

*   Use FASconCAT to concatenate the 15 gene files into a single supermatrix file.
*  Fasconcat helped take all 15 dna sequence files and combine them into one to run on IQ Tree

### Step 7: IQ-Tree

*   Run the FASconCAT output file in IQ-Tree to perform phylogenetic analysis. This will provide statistics and details about the phylogenetic tree.
* once we have the results we can run it on Figtree to see the results
### Step 8: FigTree

*   Visualize the resulting phylogenetic tree using FigTree.
*   Compare the results to the original article.

### FigTree Setup and Usage

*   **Website:**  [https://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/](https://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/)
*   **GitHub:** [https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/releases](https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/releases)

#### Installation

1.  Download and install FigTree from the website or GitHub.
2.  Follow the tutorial for proper installation.
3. read the txt file on figtree and how I used it. I have it in the scripts folder for reference.

#### Launching FigTree

1.  Navigate to your FigTree directory (example: `C:\Users\Rushe\figtree`).
2.  Launch FigTree using the command:

    ```
    java -jar C:\Users\Rushe\figtree\dist\figtree.jar
    ```

    *If you encounter issues with the Java version, use the command `java -version` to check your Java installation.*
3.  Open the file named `cleaned_supermatrix.fas.treefile` (must have the `.treefile` extension).
4.  Save the phylogenetic tree as a PDF or PNG file.
* this is where I placed my figtree and there are alot of youtube videos do tutorials on how to use figtree in detail.
