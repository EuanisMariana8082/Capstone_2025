# where I have mine stored 

# my Figtree is in this directory 
cd C:\Users\Rushe\figtree

#  I use this command to launch my Figtree
java -jar C:\Users\Rushe\figtree\dist\figtree.jar

# I use this command if I get issues with my java version 
java -version

# once the Figtree opens I just open the file called "cleaned_supermatrix.fas.treefile"
# it has to say .treefile in order to open in figtree 
# I learned that the best option to save your phylogenetic tree is in a pdf or png
